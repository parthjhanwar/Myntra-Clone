# myntra-clone
This is a clone of the Myntra website, which is completely made using HTML and CSS. I have added most of the content which gets displayed on the Myntra's home page when we visit their website.

Features include:
1) It is a responsive clone, so it's use can be extended to mobiles as well.
2) Use of utility classes.
